# hello-world
read the instructions of Github to create one.

I have heard about github for a long time. 
I am very interested in programming and I am a junior student in Chinese college. 
Interested in game and willing to get to know how to develop it.
English is not a big problem but needs improving
Business Students but a soul for programming(for now :) )
Python for now. Maybe more things will be learned in future.
